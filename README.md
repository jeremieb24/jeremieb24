- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremie, you call call me Jay for short.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Game dev, gaming and watching youtube instead of working on my projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning intermediate unity stuff, shaders and vfx and a bit of web dev in react/springboot for my daily job.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : via email at jeremieb24@live.com or via discord at MinouPitou#4106.
- I have a degree in CS and i love to work on small game/prototype (even if i have trouble finishing them). I love the indie scene and a dream of mine would be to release a polished game. In everyday life, i'm a web and a loving boyfriend
